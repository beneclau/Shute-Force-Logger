# SHUTE_Logger_DTU_Byg

Simple Logging and analysis tool for DTU Byg. Based on the Win-Valse project.

Things to do:
============
Create four panes in the main application:
1. Showing relative temperature change for each sensing point, very basic UI
2. Tracking of each peak using DGA
3. Spectral output with settings for DGA tracking
4. Calibration values for each sensing point for temperature measurement.

The development flow:

- [ ] Pane 3
- [ ] Pane 2
- [ ] Pane 4
- [ ] Pane 1

General style guidelines:
============
Naming convention for variables : testVariable

Naming conevention for methods, classes etc: TestClass

Try to only have a method do one thing - it makes it easier to read void Main

Define class inherent values as properties, not public variables
